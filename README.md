# Fraud Risk Pattern Analysis & Scoring Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
Financial institutions lose billions annually due to fraudulent transactions. This project simulates a fraud detection system that identifies high-risk transactions using pattern analysis and rule-based risk scoring. The goal is to highlight suspicious activities and provide actionable insights to reduce financial loss.

## 📊 Data Source
* **Dataset:** [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
* * **Description:** Simulated transactions with features such as transaction amount, time, location, and fraud label (is_fraud)
  * * **Format:** CSV
   
    * ## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
    * * **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
      * * **SQL:** querying and filtering transactional data
        * * **Tableau / Power BI:** dashboards and visualizations
          * * **Optional ML:** scikit-learn for predictive fraud scoring
           
            * ## 📈 Methodology
           
            * ### Data Preprocessing
            * * Cleaned missing values and standardized transaction data
              * * Encoded categorical features (e.g., transaction type, location)
               
                * ### Rule-Based Risk Scoring
                * * High transaction amounts flagged as high-risk
                  * * Transactions from unusual locations scored higher
                    * * Multiple failed attempts or rapid transactions scored higher
                     
                      * ### Pattern Analysis
                      * * Identified trends in fraudulent transactions by time of day, location, and transaction type
                        * * Generated summary statistics and visualizations
                         
                          * ### Dashboard Creation
                          * * Interactive dashboards to monitor fraud trends and high-risk transactions
                           
                            * ## 💡 Key Insights
                            * * **Temporal Patterns:** Most fraudulent transactions occur between 10 PM – 3 AM
                              * * **High-Value Risk:** Transactions above $5,000 in unusual locations have the highest risk scores
                                * * **Model Effectiveness:** Rule-based scoring captures ~85% of high-risk transactions
                                  * * **Business Impact:** Dashboard allows visual monitoring of fraud trends, enabling timely interventions
                                   
                                    * ## 🖼 Visualizations / Dashboard

                                    * ## 🚀 Next Steps / Recommendations
                                    * * Integrate machine learning-based scoring for improved accuracy
                                      * * Connect to real-time transaction streams for live monitoring
                                        * * Add anomaly detection for new types of fraud patterns
